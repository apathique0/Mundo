## Discord

since this code lacks documentation the best help you can get is my knowledge, proper questions can be asked in this [discord](https://discord.gg/3wknX5gxaW) server, please note that I will not guide you to achieve something or answer beginner level questions

### Download

The latest pre-compiled Mundo version can be found in the [Release Section](https://github.com/Riotphobia/Mundo/releases)

### Running Mundo

Mundo is not a directory, its a `.jar` file. If for whatever reason a directory opens rather than an application the easiest solution is to download, and run `Jarfix`
